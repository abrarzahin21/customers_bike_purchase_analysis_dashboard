The project begins by importing the raw data of 1000 individuals who have bought bikes. The data includes information such as a person's gender, Marital Status, Own Home, Occupation, salary, and geographical location.

1️⃣ Gender: This field captures the gender of each individual, indicating whether they are male or female.

2️⃣ Marital Status: This field records the marital status of each person, such as married, single

3️⃣ Own Home: This field indicates whether the individual owns a home or not. It can be a binary field with values like "Yes" or "No."

4️⃣ Occupation: This field captures the occupation of each person, which provides insight into their professional background or job type.

5️⃣ Salary: This field represents the salary or income of each individual, which can be expressed in a specific currency or range.

6️⃣ Geographical Location: This field records the geographical location of each person, which can include their city, state, country, or any other relevant location information.

By analyzing this dataset using SQL and Excel, the project aims to explore relationships and patterns between these variables and bike purchases. It may include examining bike preferences based on gender, marital status, or occupation. Additionally, the project can analyze how factors like owning a home or salary level influence bike purchasing decisions. The geographical location information can be utilized to identify regional trends or preferences in bike sales.
